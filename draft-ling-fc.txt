Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for synchronizing Forwarding
   Commitment (FC) across on-path ASes without leaking more AS_PATH
   information than BGP.  An FC is a digitally signed object that
   verifies that an IP address prefix is announced from AS a to AS b.
   On-path ASes can then verify the FCs and filter the potential
   malicious BGP routes, which are generated based on previously
   received BGP-UPDATE messages.

1.  Introduction

   The fundamental cause of the path manipulation attacks in inter-
   domain routing is that the de facto Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   [RFC4271] does not have any built-in mechanism to authenticate
   routing announcements.  As a result, an adversary can announce
   virtually arbitrary paths to a prefix while the receiver network
   cannot effectively verify the authenticity of the route
   announcements.

   The most representative solution given by Internet Engineering Task
   Force (IETF) is path validation through replacing BGP with BGPsec
   [RFC8205].  Yet BGPsec is not incrementally deployable.  It tightly
   couples the path authentication with the BGP path construction
   itself, where an AS is required to iteratively verify the signatures
   of each prior hop before extending the authentication chain with its
   own approval.  As a result, a single legacy AS can terminate the
   authentication chain, preventing the downstream ASes from reinstating
   the authentication process.  In addition, the performance hit
   introduced by BGPsec is significant because it has to authenticate
   the entire path even if only part of the hops are changed.
   Meanwhile, although path authorization is native to path-aware
   Internet architecture, none of these protocols are fully compatible
   with BGP.  This implies that unless the current Internet routing
   system experiences a fundamental paradigm shift towards path-aware
   routing, enforcing path authorization in inter-domain routing is
   challenging.

   Forwarding Commitment (FC) is a signed object that binds the IP
   prefix with AS and its next hops, eventually, it could compose and
   help to validate the path of BGP-UPDATE propagation.  However,
   inserting the FC into BGP-UPDATE messages will introduce performance
   hits such as BGPsec.

   This document describes a way to synchronize FC across all on-path
   ASes without AS_PATH leakage, on-path ASes can then verify the FCs
   and filter the potential malicious BGP routes, which are generated
   based on previously received BGP-UPDATE messages.  To ensure that the
   FC-synchronization mechanism can be incrementally deployed, this
   document defines:

   1.  The specification of Forwarding Commitment (FC).

   2.  The way to synchronize Forwarding Commitment (FC) across on-path
       ASes when next-hop AS has deployed the mechanism.

   3.  The way to synchronize Forwarding Commitment (FC) across on-path
       ASes when next-hop AS fails to deploy the mechanism.

   4.  The way to revoke invalid Forwarding Commitment (FC) and
       synchronize the revocation message across all ASes, avoiding
       these invalid FCs being used to announce malicious BGP-UPDATE
       messages.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Assumptions

   We assume that ASes deploying the described mechanism, i.e., upgraded
   ASes, have access to an Internet-scale trust base, namely Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  RPKI's repository stores
   authoritative information about the mapping between AS numbers and
   their owned IP prefixes, as well as ASes' public keys.

   We assume a group management mechanism exists, and all upgraded ASes
   are divided into multiple groups.  For a group G with N ASes, there
   are less than N/2 malicious Ases, and other Ases are honest.  Honest
   AS is who strictly follows the protocol to complete FC
   synchronization.  Within any two groups, e.g., group G_1 and group
   G_2, any AS in G_1 maps at least one AS in G_2, and there is at least
   one honest AS in G_1 maps to another honest AS in G_2.

   We assume a dynamic member management mechanism exists.  An upgraded
   AS can join or depart a group dynamically.  This document will not
   introduce such a mechanism, thus only describing the synchronization
   mechanism in a static environment, i.e., the group members and
   mapping relationship are fixed.

3.  The specification of FC

   Suppose that AS C receives a BGP UPDATE and the path shows that P:S
   <- A <- C.  If AS C prefers to further advertise this path to its
   neighbor AS D, AS C computes FC{C,D,P} to authenticate the preference
   on the C <- D hop as follows: FC{C,D,P} = {H(C,D,P,Ver)_{SigC}, C, D,
   Ver}, where H is a (public) secure one-way hash function, C and D are
   endpoints of this hop, and Ver is the version number required in
   synchronizing missed FC messages.  SigC is the signature signed by
   the private key of AS C.

4.  Synchronize FC across on-path ASes

   An FC-TAG attribute is added to the BGP-UPDATE message, the upgraded
   AS should additionally set the Attr.VERSION and Attr.VALUE when
   receiving a BGP-UPDATE message.  Then, the AS forward the BGP-UPDATE
   message and generate FC with Attr.VERSION.

   +---------------------------------------------+
   |     +---------------+     +------------+    |
   |     |  Attr.VERSION |     | Attr.VALUE |    |
   |     +---------------+     +------------+    |
   |     |    Version    |     |   Random   |    |
   |     +---------------+     +------------+    |
   +---------------------------------------------+

              Figure 1: The structure of the FC-TAG attribute

4.1.  Next-hop AS has deployed the mechanism

   When next-hop AS is upgraded, the AS only needs to set the
   Attr.VERSION of FC-TAG attribute in BGP-UPDATE message, and sets
   Attr.VALUE to 0.  Then AS uses the version number to construct the FC
   and forward it to the next-hop AS.

4.2.  Next-hop AS fails to deploy the mechanism

   When next-hop AS fails to deploy the mechanism, the AS should also
   generate a random number and set it to the Attr.VALUE of FC-TAG
   attribute in BGP-UPDATE message.  The AS who gets the random number
   from the BGP-UPDATE message can require FC from the AS.

5.  Revoke the invalid FC

   To avoid an invalid FC being used to announce a BGP-UPDATE message,
   AS should revoke the FC when revoking the related BGP path, and the
   revocation message should be synchronized to all ASes.

5.1.  Notations

   *  Revocation Version View (RVV).  Suppose there are K ASes in the
      current ecosystem.  Each of them maintains a K-dimensional vector
      named Revocation Version View, where the i-th element records the
      version number of the latest revocation message received from AS
      i.  Specifically, the RVV of AS s is as follows:
      RVV_s={ASN_i,Ver_i}, where i is included in (1,K), ASN_i is the AS
      Number of AS i, and Ver_i is the latest version number from AS i.

   *  Intra-group Revocation Version View (IG-RVV) is a subset of RVV,
      and only includes the element records related to the ASes in the
      same group.  Specifically, for an AS s in group k, i.e., the IG-
      RVV of AS s is as follows: IG-RVV_s={ASN_i,Ver_i}, where ASN_i is
      included in G_k, G_k is a set that includes all ASN of AS in group
      k.

   *  Incremental Revocation Version View (IRVV) is an incremental
      format of RVV, tagged with a version number v.
      IRVV_j^v={v,{ASN_i,Ver_i^v}}, where v is the version number of
      IRVV and Ver_i^v is greater than Ver_{i}^{v-1}.

5.2.  Broadcast the revocation message

   When AS wants to revocate an invalid FC, it could use this message:
   M_{revocation}={Version,Revoke-version}_{Sig}, where Version is the
   version number of the revocation message, Revoke-version is the
   version number of revoked FC, and Sig is the signature of AS who
   construct the revocation message.

5.3.  Synchronize the missed messages

   Considering that some ASes may miss the revocation message during the
   message broadcast phase, a lightweight version-based Consistency
   Check Protocol (CCP) is used to synchronize the missed revocation
   messages.  The CCP includes two parts: intra-group CPP and inter-
   group CPP.

   In each period v, ASes will broadcast their local Incremental RVV,
   i.e., IRVV^v to all other members in the same group.  Upon receiving
   the IRVV_s^v from AS s, an AS j compares with its local RVV.  If the
   Ver_i^v of AS i in IRVV_s^v is greater than the Ver_i^v in local RVV,
   then AS j misses at least one new binding message from AS i.  In this
   case, besides simply adopting a newer version, AS j can proactively
   request missed binding messages from AS s.  The rationale is that the
   missing of prior updates is an indicator of weak or unstable network
   connectivities for AS j, and therefore the proactive requests are
   helpful.

   At the start of period v+1, ASes will broadcast their IG-RVV to
   mapped ASes in other groups.  When receiving an IG-RVV, ASes will
   compare it with a local RVV, and require missed binding messages from
   the sender of IG-RVV.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Protect Policy Preference

   According to the synchronization process of FC, only ASes who receive
   the BGP-UPDATE message will get the FC.  Therefore, the
   synchronization process will not leak more AS_PATH information than
   BGP.

6.2.  Mitigation of Route Hijacking Attack

   To mitigate route hijacking attacks, an AS peer can choose a more
   reliable AS for routing and forwarding.  There are four types of
   paths:

   *  TRUSTED PATH: Every hop in the AS_PATH has deployed the mechanism,
      and all related FCs are received and verified.

   *  PARTIALLY TRUSTED PATH: At least one hop fails to deploy the
      mechanism.

   *  LEGACY PATH: All ASes in the AS_PATH fail to deploy the mechanism.

   *  SUSPICIOUS PATH: Misses a corresponding FC from at least one
      upgraded hop on the AS_PATH.

   For LEGACY PATHs, we cannot directly determine whether they are
   SUSPICIOUS PATHs because the ASes have not deployed FC-BGP.
   Therefore, the security of a route announcement is directly
   proportional to the number of ASes that have deployed FC-BGP.

   For non-LEGACY PATHs, they will be set to SUSPICIOUS directly because
   ASes accept BGP-UPDATE messages first and then require and verify a
   series of related FCs (FC-LIST).  Therefore, the route related to a
   SUSPICIOUS PATH can only exist for a fixed time, e.g., 10 seconds.
   Only when the AS receives and verifies the FC-LIST from the last
   upgraded AS will the related path be set to TRUSTED or PARTIALLY
   TRUSTED.

   In the route hijacking attack, the attacker cannot generate a correct
   corresponding FC because the FC lacks a signature and can be
   successfully detected by subsequent receivers.  In this case, the
   path will be set to SUSPICIOUS and only exist for a fixed time, i.e.,
   the effect of a route hijacking attack can only exist for a fixed
   time.

   Overall, to favor secure routing, the ASes joining the FC-BGP
   ecosystem SHOULD design routing policies in their local routing
   policy engines, preferring TRUSTED PATHs over PARTIALLY TRUSTED PATHs
   over LEGACY PATHs.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA actions:

   This document requests the assignment of a new attribute code
   described in Section 1 in the "FC-BGP Path Attributes" registry.  The
   attribute code for this new path attribute "FC-TAG" to provide
   consistency between the control and data planes.  This document is
   the reference for the new attribute.
